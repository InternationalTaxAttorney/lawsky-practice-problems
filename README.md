# lawsky-practice-problems
This repository contains all the code for [Lawsky Practice Problems](https://www.lawskypracticeproblems.org/). This code has been used in the past to generate tax problems [to test the capabilities of large language models](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4476325). There is also a requirements.txt file to make it easier to get this running.

You can use it for that or for anything else, subject to the terms of [the license under which I have made this code available](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html). There are almost certainly mistakes in this code; I will keep it up to date to some degree, but I will not necessarily push all changes to this respository right away. And I learned how to program by writing this code, so there are also definitely some...interesting programming choices here. 

If you create a project or write a paper using this code please let me know, so that I can add a link to your project on the [Practice Problems website](https://www.lawskypracticeproblems.org/otherprojects). I would also very much appreciate it if you would credit me and this repository in your project.

A few notes about setting this up, if you want to run the whole thing:
# Add empty two folders within the directory where you're running it, one called saved_code and one called saved_files.
# The CodeRegs folder is enormous; that's where the Code and Reg dictionaries are to generate the code site. I would suggest commenting out the code and regs page unless you really need it for something and just not downloading that folder at all.
